# Networking Project: Basic Networking with Python

This project demonstrates how to connect a virtual Android system to a backend server using Python. The client (Android system) sends mock data to a server via HTTP requests and logs the server's response.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   In the root directory of the project, create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary packages like `requests` and `Flask` for the client and server.

## Running the Flask Server (`server.py`)

The Flask server handles incoming data from the client.

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory (if you placed `server.py` inside it):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   The server will start locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. It listens for POST requests at `/api`.

## Running the Client (`main.py`)

The `main.py` script sends mock data (such as device ID and system info) to the backend server and logs the response.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Edit the `SERVER_URL` in `main.py` to point to your Flask server (default is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api`):

   ```python
   SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api"
   ```

3. Run the client script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The client will send a POST request to the server with mock data and log the server's response to the `logs/app.log` file.

## Log Output

The server response (success or failure) is logged in the `logs/app.log` file. You can check the log to view the response details.

Example log entry:
```
2024-12-13 10:00:00,000 - Data successfully sent to the server. Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Data received successfully"}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **403 Forbidden Error**: 
   - Ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly set in the client script (if required). You may need to provide a valid API token.
   - Check that the server is properly configured to accept requests from the client.

- **Server Not Running**: 
   - Ensure that the Flask server (`server.py`) is running before executing the client script. If the server is not running, the client won't be able to connect and will fail.

- **Missing Directories or Files**:
   - If the `logs` directory is missing, the script will create it automatically. However, if you encounter any issues, ensure the `logs` directory exists.

## Notes

- This project is meant to demonstrate basic networking concepts and client-server communication using Python.
- You can expand the server functionality to handle more complex requests or integrate a real backend API instead of the mock server.

### Instructions for Usage:
- **Step 1**: Set up the environment and dependencies as described.
- **Step 2**: Run the Flask server (`server.py`) to handle incoming requests.
- **Step 3**: Run the client (`main.py`) to send mock data to the server and log the responses.
